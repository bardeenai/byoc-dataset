We have previously analyzed the proteome of urinary exosomes by mass spectrometry, and identified proteins differentially expressed in prostate cancer patients compared to healthy males. Since mass spectrometry is so far not commonly used in clinical laboratories, we have here investigated whether antibody-based methods such as Western blot or ELISA can be used to validate the use of the identified proteins as prostate cancer biomarkers. Western blot experiments designed to detect flotillin 2, TMEM256, Rab3B and LAMTORI showed that the level of these proteins was higher in urinary exosomes from prostate cancer patients compared to healthy males. Furthermore, a receiver operating characteristic curve of flotillin 2 in samples from 16 controls and 16 patients showed an area under the curve of 0.91, and 88% sensitivity at a threshold set to give 94% specificity. In addition, ELISA-based detection of flotillin 2 and PARK7 showed that the combination of these proteins was able to distinguish prostate cancer patients and healthy controls with 68% sensitivity and 93% specificity. Several promising biomarkers identified by mass spectrometry could not be evaluated by Western blot or ELISA due to their low exosomal amount and/or lack of good antibodies. In conclusion, our results show that several urinary exosomal proteins identified as, prostate cancer biomarkers by mass spectrometry have a high diagnostic value also when analyzed by immunology-based methods, thus bringing these biomarkers closer to a potential clinical use.

The cause of the declined function is unknown. Decreased phagocyte function can lead to the higher infection rate in healthy pregnancy and may also be responsible for the increased susceptibility to infections and high trophoblast concentration in preeclampsia. The aim of this study is to examine the phagocyte function of neutrophil granulocytes and monocytes. Methods: Monocytes and neutrophil granulocytes were separated from the peripheral circulation of six nonpregnant patients and incubated in plasma samples from six healthy pregnant, six preeclamptic pregnant, and six nonpregnant patients. The cells were marked and evaluated for the phagocytosis index with immunofluorescent microscope after phagocyting the zymosan molecules. Results: Phagocyte function of neutrophils as well as monocytes from nonpregnant patients were decreased significantly when the cells were incubated in plasma samples from healthy pregnant patients, and further decreased when incubated in plasma samples from preeclamptic pregnant women. Conclusion: The decreased phagocyte function of neutrophil granulocytes and that of monocytes in healthy pregnancy and the further decreased phagocyte function in preeclampsia is caused by factor(s) in the maternal circulation.\nOutput: "

We used a fluid percussion injury (FPI) model to assess the effect of mild hypothermia on pericontusion neuronal sprouting after TBI in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent FPI or sham surgery, followed by mild hypothermia treatment (33 degrees C) or normothermia treatment (37 degrees C) for 3 h. All the rats were euthanized at 7 days after FPI. Neuronal sprouting that was confirmed by an increase in growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43) expression was evaluated using immunofluorescence and Western blot assays. The expression levels of several intrinsic and extrinsic sprouting-associated genes such as neurite outgrowth inhibitor A (NogoA), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Our results revealed that mild hypothermia significantly increased the expression level of GAP-43 and dramatically suppressed the expression level of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and SOCS3 at 7 days after FPI in the ipsilateral cortex compared with that of the normothermia TBI group. These data suggest that post-traumatic mild hypothermia promotes pericontusion neuronal sprouting after TBI. Moreover, the mechanism of hypothermia-induced neuronal sprouting might be partially associated with decreased levels of SOCS3.\nOutput: "

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty implants were selected, inserted in 20 patients, 10 with a screwed implant-abutment connection (Group 1) and 10 with a cemented implant-abutment connection (Group 2). The peri-implant microflora was collected, after at least 360 days from the prosthetic rehabilitation, using paper points inserted in peri-implant sulcus for 30 s. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Real-time analyzed the presence of 9 bacteria periodontal-pathogens and Candida albicans. RESULTS: Our findings showed that bacteria colonized all Groups analyzed, the average bacterial count was 3.7 E + 08 (+/- 1.19) in Group 1, compared to 2.1 E + 08 (+/- 0.16) in Group 2; no statistically significant differences were observed (p >0.0.5). In Group 1, however, bacterial colonization of peri-implant sulci was over the pathogenic threshold for 5 bacteria, indicating a high-risk of peri-implantitis. Also in Group 2, results showed a microflora composed by all bacteria analyzed but, in this case, bacterial colonization of peri-implant sulci was over the pathogenic threshold for only 1 bacterium, indicating a lower risk of peri-implantitis. Moreover, clinical parameters (PPD >3 mm and m SBI >0) confirmed a greater risk of peri-implantitis in Group 1 compared to Group 2 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that, also after only 360 days, implants with screwed connection showed a higher risk of peri-implantitis that implants with cemented connection.\nOutput: "

In this study, CarNAC3 was transformed into hybrid poplar plants (Populus deltoides x P. euramericana 'Nanlin895') using Agrobacterium tumefaciens. PCR analysis confirmed integration of the introduced T-DNA into the target genome. Reverse transcription PCR confirmed the transformation, and Southern and northern blotting verified the transgene copy number and gene expression, respectively. Fourteen lines of positive transformants were transplanted into a greenhouse to verify their drought and salt tolerances. Under normal conditions, transgenic poplar plants were shorter than the wild-type, but under drought and salt stresses, they maintained their normal rooting and stem growth rates, while those of the wild-type plants were suppressed. Under stress conditions, CarNAC3 expression caused increases in proline and photosynthetic pigment levels and in antioxidant enzyme activities. Furthermore, the expression of CarNAC3 lowered malondialdehyde concentrations compared with the wild-type control. Overall, our results indicated that the CarNAC3 transgene enhanced drought and salt tolerance in transgenic poplar plants.\nOutput: "

To understand the relationship between longan fruit growth and XET gene expression patterns, three XET genes from fruit were identified and then their expression profiles in pericarp and aril tissues of fruit at different development stages were investigated. Three full-length cDNAs of 1077, 1093 and I IS I bp encoding XETs, named DIXET1, DIXET2 and DIXET3, respectively, were isolated from expanding fruit using RT-PCR and RACE-PCR (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) methods. Northern blotting analysis showed that three DIXET mRNAs exhibited different patterns during fruit growth and development. Accumulation of MET] kept changeable during the fruit growth and development, DI-XET2 mRNA accumulations in the pericarp, and in the aril increased gradually following fruit growth during the whole fruit developmental stage. In addition, DIXET3 did not accumulate in the pericarp during the whole fruit development stage, but it could be detected in the aril of fruit during the rapid aril growth stage (63-74 DAA). These results indicated that DIXET2 was associated with growth of pericarp and aril in longan fruit, while DIXET1 was related to pericarp growth and DIXET3 was primarily responsible for aril growth. To further characterize the expressions of three XETs regulated by plant growth substances, alpha-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) and thidiazuron (TDZ) were used to treat longan fruit at 21 DAA and 56 DAA when pericarp, and aril grew rapidly respectively, it was found that treatment at 21 DAA, only TDZ increased the accumulation of DIXET2 mRNA at 12 h after treatment. However, both NAA and TDZ increased the accumulation of DIXET3 after 36 h treatment, although DIXET-3 did not accumulate in the whole fruit. While, treatment at 56 DAA, both NAA and TDZ increased the accumulations of DIXETs in aril except DIXET3 in aril by NAA treatment. In addition. the expression patterns of the three XETs showed different tissue specificity. These results suggested that XET genes played a different role in longan fruit growth and showed different response to plant growth substances which existed difference at different growth stage.

In the absence of inducer d-ribose, the ribose operon is repressed by a LacI-type transcription factor RbsR, which is encoded by a gene located downstream of this ribose operon. At present, the rbs operon is believed to be the only target of regulation by RbsR. After Genomic SELEX screening, however, we have identified that RbsR binds not only to the rbs promoter but also to the promoters of a set of genes involved in purine nucleotide metabolism. Northern blotting analysis indicated that RbsR represses the purHD operon for de novo synthesis of purine nucleotide but activates the add and udk genes involved in the salvage pathway of purine nucleotide synthesis. Taken together, we propose that RbsR is a global regulator for switch control between the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides and its salvage pathway.\nOutput: "

In cases where the text discusses multiple techniques but doesn't delve deeply into any, it could be beneficial to classify it into multiple categories. This would ensure that the abstract is captured in searches related to all the techniques discussed.\n\n"
        },
        "explanation": "The correct classification is 'northern blotting' because this technique was explicitly used and mentioned in the study. Even though the text discussed a biological process and regulation, the focus on the use of Northern blotting for the investigation would weigh heavier in determining the classification. Therefore, the text fits best under 'northern blotting' which refers to a common technique used to detect specific RNA sequences within a complex mixture of RNA. This methodology is central to the findings presented in the text.",
        "reflection": "The text primarily focuses on the utilization of d-ribose and the regulation of purine nucleotide metabolism, with the use of Northern blotting as a key component of the research methodology. While the text also delves into molecular biology aspects and the discussion of regulation, the classification is determined by the primary methodological focus, which in this case is Northern blotting. This classification ensures that the text is categorized accurately based on the specific technique used in the study.",

                "question": "When a text discusses a biological process in detail, such as the utilization of d-ribose by Escherichia coli in this example, but also mentions a technique like Northern blotting in the context of the study's findings, how should the text be classified? Should it be under 'molecular biology' due to the focus on the biological process, or 'northern blotting' because of the technique's use in the study, or both?",
                "explanation": "The user's class descriptions provide some guidance on how to classify texts when they discuss a biological process or a technique, but it's not entirely clear how to handle cases where both are present. The current text discusses the biological process of how Escherichia coli utilizes d-ribose, which would suggest a 'molecular biology' classification. However, it also mentions the use of Northern blotting in the context of the study's findings, which could potentially warrant a 'northern blotting' classification. Understanding the user's preference in such cases would help clarify the classification criteria and improve the scope of the class descriptions.",
                "answer": "The text should be classified under 'northern blotting' because of the technique's use in the study. The utilization of Northern blotting for analysis was a key component of the research's methodology and findings. While the text does delve into molecular biology aspects, the classification would focus on the technique used, which in this case is Northern blotting."

                "question": "If a text discusses a biological process in detail, such as the utilization of d-ribose by Escherichia coli in this example, but also discusses the regulation of a biological process (in this case, switch control between the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides and its salvage pathway), how should the text be classified? Should it still fall under 'molecular biology' or would it be more appropriate to consider it under 'immunology' given the discussion of regulation?",
                "explanation": "This question aims to clarify the user's classification criteria when a text discusses the regulation of a biological process. While the class descriptions provide some guidance, they do not specifically address this scenario. Understanding how the user views the discussion of regulation in relation to the class categories can help refine the class descriptions and improve the classifier's accuracy.",
                "answer": "Despite the discussion of the regulation of a biological process, this text would still be classified under 'northern blotting'. The basis for the classification is the use of the northern blotting technique in the study. While the text discusses aspects of molecular biology and regulatory systems, which could be a part of immunology as well, the primary methodological focus appears to be on northern blotting. This technique is used to study the biological process and its regulation, therefore, the text should be classified under 'northern blotting'."

                "question": "In cases where a text discusses a biological process in detail, but also mentions a technique like Northern blotting, would the mention of another technique (such as PCR or a technique related to immunology) change the classification? Or would the text still be classified under 'northern blotting' due to the primary methodological focus?",
                "explanation": "This question aims to understand how the user would handle texts that mention multiple techniques. The user's previous responses have indicated that the primary methodological focus is a key factor in classification. However, it would be helpful to know how the user would classify a text that discusses multiple techniques in detail. This could help us refine the class descriptions and understand how to handle texts that could potentially fall under multiple classes.",
                "answer": "If Northern blotting still remains as one of the primary methodologies discussed, then the text should stay classified under 'northern blotting'. Even if other techniques are mentioned, it's the primary method used which determines the classification. If multiple methodologies are discussed equally, it may be necessary to classify under multiple categories. However, in this context where Northern blotting is a key component of the research methodology, the classification should remain as 'northern blotting'."
